#+TITLE: XenServer Admin Scripts
These are works in progress for performing common XenServer CLI tasks. They are somewhat site-specific and have some known bugs.

* Assumptions
  - name labels are unique among each type of object (VM, SR, network...)
  - host name label is same as hostname
  - each host's local storage has name label 'Local storage'

* Environment variables
  - XE_SERVER
  - XE_PORT
  - XE_USER
  - XE_PASSWORD

* Reasons
  - =vm-uninstall= leaves orphan VDIs
  ...to be completed...
